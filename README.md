# RecFi_Rates
Approached by the director of IT at RecFi to build a public webpage for use as a QR code landing zone. In use, the QR code will be on RecFi employee business cards, and scanning the QR will take vendors to the site to view their rate pages and other information. This site was designed with mobile-first in mind, but also performs as intended on other platforms. RecFi wanted to keep it simple with a focus on utility, so it was made as a static webpage solely with HTML and CSS.
